## vmstorage

This component is the clusterâ€™s heaviest consumer of CPU and memory.  
During every restart or Pod recreation it briefly saturates available resources; once
initialization completes, CPU drops sharply to a low baseline, while memory only falls
modestly.  
In addition, some background tasks such as deduplication periodically drive CPU usage
to near-peak levels for a few seconds and then almost instantly collapse back to baseline.


## Capacity planning

> https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/#capacity-planning

- It is recommended to run a cluster with big number of small vmstorage nodes instead of a cluster with small number of big vmstorage nodes.
- Query latency can be reduced by increasing CPU resources per each vmselect node, since each incoming query is processed by a single vmselect node.
