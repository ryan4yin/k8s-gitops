# Instance Types

Instance types are a way to categorize virtual machines based on their CPU and memory
configurations.
Anything provided within an instance type cannot be overridden within the VirtualMachine.

The following instance types are available:

1. `s-xxx`: Standard Series (CPU:MEM = 1:1)
2. `c-xxx`: Compute Series (CPU:MEM = 1:2)
3. `hpc-xxx`: High Performance Computing Series (CPU:MEM = 1:2)
4. `m-xxx`: Memory Optimized Series (CPU:MEM = 1:4)
